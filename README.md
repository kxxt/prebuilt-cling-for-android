# prebuilt cling binary for debian in UserLAnd on Android(arm64)

You can download it from the Releases page.

It takes my Android tablet approximately 3.5 hours to download and build it.

Hope this prebuilt binary is useful for someone else.

You may need to install some system dependencies manually.

Usage: 
- Decompress it and you will get an `inst` folder.
- Execute `./inst/bin/cling`.

If this repo helps you, don't forget to give it a star.
